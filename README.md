# Causal-Sets-Code-
Causal set codes for my reseach 

This includes all the coding performed during my graduate level(MS) for causal sets theory. 
I have calculated Action of causal sets using Benincasa-Dowker method and Chain method. 
I have checked the validity of Chain Action in much more detail.
